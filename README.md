Anonymous Voting for your email chains
--------------------------------------

This web app is a final project for the Odin Curriculum. The basic idea
is to create an anonymous platform for answering questions that might
arise in your personal emails chains.

## Technologies that I used:

#### Backend
- Ruby/Rails
- Devise (authentication)

- Mandrill (email)

#### Frontend
- jQuery

- redcarpet (markdown)
- Bourbon (SASS library)
- Neat (grid framework, compliments bourbon library)
- Bitters (css styles, compliments bourbon library)
- Mailchimp templates (email)
